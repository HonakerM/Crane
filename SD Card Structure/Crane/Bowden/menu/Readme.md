**The /menu/ subfolder -- Duet 2 Maestro

The Duet 2 Maestro uses an identical folder structure to the Duet 2 Wifi and Ethernet, except for this folder: /menu. This holds the files that define the menu layouts for 128x64 pixel monochrome displays.  The Code driving the 12864 itself is a derivative of the commonly distributed lcd7920 library.
